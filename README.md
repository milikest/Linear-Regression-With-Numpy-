This is a Coursera Guided Project that aims to implement basic machine learning algorithms. 
In the project a company profit and population is being investigated. 
In first part we visualised the data and look at the tabular form too.
In second part we implemented cost function and gradient descent algorithm by using basic python and numpy operations. We used mathematical explanation for these algorithms too. 
In thirth part we visualised cost function.
In the last part we visualised our regression line with data and made some predictions with our simple model. 

DEPENDENCIES:
Python 3+
Numpy
